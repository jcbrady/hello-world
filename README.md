Getting to know stuff. How do you get to know stuff? By doing stuff. 
I am currently reading a book about stuff. It was written by someone who studied a lof of stuff before they became knowledgable. 

"Stuff?" is such a broad term, why don't you talk about something?
"Something" is also a broad term, in fact it's just as broad a term as "stuff," why do you have such a problem with the word, "stuff?" 
I never said I had a problem with it, I just want to talk about something, something else.
Something besides stuff?
Yes!
Then why did you bring up the issue in the first place?

You seem argumentative.
No, I don't! You do!
Now you're full of blame!
You started it!

An argument with oneself must become twoself in order to exist? The word, twoself doesn't exist, this is foolish. The term "stuff" could have turned into "something," but you refused to see its merit! My concept didn't develop because an argument was started and that lead to nowhere. 
You mean, "now here" not nowhere, so there is afterall, a point to this. 
A point? What's your point?
My point is that you're being argumentative!
No you are! 
But we're the same, we are one.

Oh, yeah ... right. I'm soooooo used to arguing with others that I automatically argue with myself, becoming "twoselves" which is only possible in the mind and not even an official word. So who are you?

I'm the one who will take the blame in this case. 
Why, I'm the one who started it. 
Okay, you take the blame, as you initially said. 
Way to maneuver, I see your tricks!
Okay, shall we talk about something specific?
Something? I knew it, you wanted to talk about "something" all along. 
Yes, something besides the broad term of "stuff."

There you go again, "something" is just as broad a term as "stuff," and you know it! 
No it isn't, because if I ask us to talk about something, it requires that we move forward. This is good, and will potentially lead to a discussion more specific than if we stick to the term "stuff." Do you get it now?
Uh, okay, I think I'm starting to get it. However, how about we talk about "specific stuff" rather than "something?" Would that be okay with you?  
Fine, let's just stop this disagreement already. 

We are not two because we are one. 
Yes, exactly!
Once one knows how to best go about speaking to oneself, they can learn and have good discussions and are in agreement with themselves. 
But arguments can become fruitful also, can they not? Could threeselves be a word, and could themselves also represent twoselves?
I guess.
Okay, but I'm still confused.
Don't worry about it, this is how it feels when one begins learning to program.
